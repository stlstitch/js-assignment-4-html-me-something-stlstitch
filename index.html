               <h2 class="mainHeading"> My Journey</h2>
               <p>My journey with FIRST® began in the late 90’s while I was home on spring break.  I was watching the old scrolling guide channel on the TV when I saw something on ESPN that said “…at EPCOT.”  Being that I was, and still am, enamored with everything Disney, I had at that point seen every behind the scenes show about Disney World, Disneyland, and the Disney Animation division.  This love of Disney, led me to watching whatever ESPN was showing from there.  I turned it on and saw the familiar EPCOT Logo and some robots moving around with kids running the controls.  I found it so interesting that I watched for over an hour.</p>  
               <p>As a kid, I had no idea that those robots were built and programmed by kids.  I just knew they were operating them and I wanted even more to go to Disney World to “play” with these robots.  Little did I know then, that I would get to be a part of that years later.</p>  
               <p>My High School had no robotics classes, no team, not even an engineering class.  I remember going to my guidance counselor and explaining that I wanted to be a Disney Imagineer.  I still remember his response, “What is that?”  I launched into explaining that the people who worked at Disney creating rides, shows, parades, etc. were called Imagineers.  He stared at me puzzled and said, “Well, we have a wood shop class.  But you will have to pay for all your own wood for the assignments up front.”  I felt two challenges to this.  One, I had no interest in building a bird house, spice rack, or book shelf.  Two, there was a lack of disposable income in my family.  I wanted to create things that would bring people the same joy I felt when experiencing Disney-related things.  I struck out with my high school.</p>
               <p>In high school I often felt like I did not belong; like I had no one who truly wanted me to be a part of something.  When I finally got to college, I took on a “This is Me” attitude and found myself gravitating towards the radio program.  I also found myself working at the Saint Louis Science Center in Guest Services.  It was February of 2004 when I spotted a flyer in the lobby of the Science Center for a robotics competition at one of our local arenas.  The game was “FIRST Frenzy: Raising the Bar.”  I spoke with Frank Kusiak, who worked at the museum about the event and asked what it was.  He gave a me a synopsis and invited me to volunteer.  I really had no idea what I was getting into, but I signed up for field reset.  I was told it would get me near the field and I would really get a lot out of it.</p>
               <p class="funParagraph">That was the spark… It recaptured my imagination and the excitement I felt from watching that “thing at EPCOT on ESPN.”  I was hooked.  It was 3 or 4 years later that I learned that this was that “thing” I saw on my spring break in the 90’s.</p>  
               <p>I moved from Field Reset to Refereeing before landing on Game Announcing.  I am currently in my 16th year volunteering with FIRST®.  My journey has had some serious ups and downs.  In 2009, my Dad passed away after a multi-year battle with a multitude of health issues.  I began to seriously doubt what my purpose is.  Why I was where I was at in my educational path, career path, and emotional path.  I began to feel undervalued and unappreciated.  This self-doubt went on for a while and the one thing that made me feel happy was FIRST®.  Volunteering at Events, adding my voice to color matches or introduce teams was exciting for me.  It made me feel like I had a purpose.  But that bit of doubt still kept clouding my vision.  Thanks to this organization I was able to meet someone who helped me land a job at the legendary NewsRadio 1120 KMOX in Saint Louis.</p>
               <p>Championship came to Saint Louis in 2011 and I will never forget the experience of walking out onto floor of the Dome at America's Center.  The fields were set up, NASA had a LIVE truck in the middle of the A/V crew, and the energy hit me.  I was part of team queuing on Archimedes / Curie.  I started meeting people from other parts of the world who were involved in FIRST®; people who were as excited as I was to be there.  Two years later, I would meet Marin Kobin from Long Island and Virginia at a time where I was considering leaving FIRST®.  She inspired me to stay, she showed me without knowing it, that I was still wanted, I was still needed.  Her simple joy in making sure teams got to where they needed to be made me realize I hadn’t become unappreciated or undervalued, I was in a place to grow on my FIRST® journey.  With her support I took on being Lead Queuer at Championship on the Field next to hers.  She introduced me to Koko Ed, Eitahn Kahn, and Patrick Foley; all of whom accepted me as equals.</p>  
               <p>I learned a lot and I grew even more.  Without placing an expectation on myself, I was able to move into and accept roles I would not have otherwise considered.  In FIRST® Tech Challenge I moved from Master of Ceremonies / Game Announcer into Judging where I learn as much from the children in the program as they learn from myself and other adults who are involved.  I rose to a role of Managing Queuer during the first year of Championship in Houston.  A role I was humbled to be offered and excited to take on.  The following year, I finally made my debut as a Championship Game Announcer in Houston, a role I had all but given up on seeking.  Marin gave me the push to speak with Blair about the role and again this year I was a Game Announcer in Houston.</p>  
               <p>This year also marked another first for me; I became a Mentor for a team.  For the first time in my life, I was a part of a team.  FRC Team 1178 DURT from De Smet Jesuit High School in Saint Louis took me on to help the team become better at public speaking.  In the first 15 years of my involvement with FIRST® I was never a part of a team.  I am not an Alum of this program and every year I encounter people who believe that you have to be a part of a team to want to volunteer or be part of this program.  I am proof that this is not true.</p>  
               <p>I am often asked why I give so much time to this organization despite my own struggles to make it possible and my answer is always the same.  No One Changes The World Alone and I am helping these kids Inspire the World.</p>
